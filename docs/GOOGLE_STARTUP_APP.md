## 1. Short Description (One-Liner)

> **Axiom RESET is Egypt's first AI Operating System for SMEs—replacing high-commission platforms with autonomous Google Cloud ADK agents for a flat $1.99/month subscription.**

---

## 2. Detailed Description

### Headline: Democratizing AI for the Emerging Markets Economy

#### The Problem

Small businesses in Egypt and the MENA region are trapped in an **"Extraction Economy."** Traditional platforms (delivery, real estate, retail) charge debilitating commissions (15-30%), while gig workers (drivers) lose significant earnings to middleman fees. Advanced AI technology remains inaccessible to the average falafel shop or local pharmacy.

#### The Solution

Axiom RESET is a decentralized **AI Operating System** that empowers businesses to own their digital workforce. Instead of paying commissions, businesses subscribe to specialized AI Agents for a flat micro-SaaS fee.

#### Our Fleet of 6 AI Agents

| Agent | Sector | Mission | Pricing |
|:------|:-------|:--------|:--------|
| **Sofra** 🍽️ | Restaurants | AI Waiter, Menu RAG, Kitchen OS | $1.99/mo (0% comm) |
| **Tajer** 🏭 | B2B/Factories | Connecting manufacturers to merchants | $1.99/mo |
| **Aqar** 🏠 | Real Estate | Student housing & Sahel rentals | $1.99/mo |
| **Dr. Moe** 💊 | Healthcare | Prescription OCR, Drug interactions | $1.99/mo |
| **Tirs** 🛵 | Logistics | Zero-commission delivery fleet | **FREE** (driver keeps 100%) |
| **Ostaz** 📚 | Education | AI Private Tutor per subject | $2.99/subject |

#### Our Unique Value Proposition

1. **Zero Commission:** Merchants keep 100% of their revenue.
2. **Drivers First:** Our logistics agent "Tirs" ensures drivers keep **100% of delivery fees**.
3. **Autonomous Operations:** Agents don't just chat; they execute. They handle routing, orders, inventory, and contracts autonomously.

## 3. Technology Stack & Google Cloud Usage

### Built on Google Cloud ADK & Vertex AI

Axiom RESET is not just a wrapper; it is an **infrastructure project** built on our proprietary **AIX (Agent Identity Exchange)** standard.

#### Core Architecture

| Layer | Google Service | Usage |
|:------|:---------------|:------|
| **Intelligence** | Vertex AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash) | Multimodal reasoning for all agents |
| **Voice** | Cloud Speech-to-Text | Egyptian Arabic voice support |
| **Vision** | Vision AI + MedLM | Prescription OCR for Dr. Moe |
| **Documents** | Document AI | Contract generation for Tajer/Aqar |
| **Routing** | Google Maps Platform | Route optimization for Sofra/Tirs |
| **Compute** | Cloud Run | MCP server deployment |
| **Real-time** | Firebase | Voice command sync ("Arc Reactor") |
| **Analytics** | BigQuery | Market analytics for merchants |

#### The AIX Standard

We created a proprietary open standard called **AIX (Agent Identity Exchange)** that packages:

- **Soul:** Agent persona and ethical guidelines
- **Capabilities:** Connected MCP servers with latency SLAs
- **Economics:** Solana wallet for autonomous transactions

```yaml
# Example: Sofra Agent AIX File
meta:
  id: "agent-sofra-v2"
  name: "Sofra"
identity:
  soul: "Every meal is a moment of joy"
capabilities:
  mcp_servers:
    - name: "mcp-google-maps"
      latency: "12ms"
economics:
  network: "solana-mainnet"
  wallet: "SoFra88XbPZBLRxeN..."
```

## 4. Why Google for Startups?

We have successfully built the MVP and deployed the Alpha version at **axiomid.app**. We are applying to the Google for Startups Cloud Program to accelerate our **MENA Expansion**:

### What We Need

**Phase 2: Egypt Scale**

1. **Scale Vertex AI inference** to support 5,000+ concurrent agents in Cairo
2. **Reduce latency** for our real-time voice interface ("The Arc Reactor")
3. **Expand Google Maps Platform** usage for Sofra and Tirs agents

**Phase 3: MENA Expansion (The Big Ask)**

We are building 3 additional agents to digitize the region's most critical underserved sectors:

| Agent | Sector | Google Tech Needed |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------|
| 🌾 **Falah** | Agriculture & Food Security | **Earth Engine** (satellite crop monitoring), **Vision AI** (disease detection), **TensorFlow on Edge** (offline-first) |
| ✈️ **Murshid** | MENA Tourism | **Maps Immersive View** (AR temple tours), **Cloud Translation** (real-time tourist-vendor translation), **Gemini 1.5 Pro** (historical storytelling) |
| 🔧 **Sanay3y** | Skilled Trades (Plumbers, Electricians) | **Vision API** (diagnose faults from photos), **Maps Routing** (locate genuine spare parts) |

> *"Axiom RESET serves as the foundational operating system to deploy these specialized Google-powered agents across the Middle East."*

### Our Traction

- ✅ MVP Live: axiomid.app
- ✅ AIX Standard Defined: v0.5.0
- ✅ 6 Agents Designed with full AIX profiles
- ✅ "Agent Cockpit" UI Complete (Uber/Talabat-style operating dashboard)

### Why Google Cloud is Our Native Home

Google Cloud is not just our provider—it's our **foundation**. Every agent reasoning call goes through Vertex AI, every route through Maps Platform, every prescription through Vision AI. Your support will directly translate to **economic empowerment for thousands of Egyptian SMEs**.
